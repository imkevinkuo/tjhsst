# sociallinks
**TJHSST AI 2015-16**  
Analyzes two different social groups:  
Each graph plots # of social connections on the x-axis and number of people with that number of social connections on the y-axis.  
Group one starts with a given population and draws random links between everyone. The plot is given by graphrand.jpg.

Group two starts with a small number of people (a "popular group") who all know each other, and iteratively adds new members to the society and gives each new member a few social links. The resulting graph is given by graphiter.jpg.

Note how in graphrand, the graph is shaped more symmetrically, while in graphiter, there are only a few popular people and most people (the new members added later) only have a few connections.
