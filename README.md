## wordladder
This Python script builds a graph with the 6-letter words in words.txt. Words with a one letter difference are neighbors in the graph.  
  
## railroad
This Python script builds a railroad graph from two text files: a location list and an edge list. Romanian cities are used for a simplified problem, while U.S.A. rail stations + major cities are used for the expanded problem.  
The program then traverses it using either A* or Dijkstra's algorithm. A* has a faster runtime than Dijkstra's, but does not fully minimize the path length.  
  
## sudoku
This Python sudoku bot uses deductions such as elimination and twin rules to solve sudoku puzzles.  
A puzzle is a string of 81 characters, where the '.' character represents an empty space. sudoku128.txt contains 128 puzzles.

## ghost
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkevinkuo/tjhsst/master/ghost/ghost.png" width="50%" align="right">  
Ghost is a game where players take turns spelling out individual letters of a word. The first player to spell out a word or a word-less prefix loses. <br><br>
This Python script creates an alphabetic trie out of the words in ghost.txt and supports any combination of human and computer players. <br><br><br>
  
## othello
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkevinkuo/tjhsst/master/othello/othello.png" width="50%" align="right">  
This Python script for Othello supports player vs. player, player vs. computer, or computer vs. computer. <br>
The computer player uses a minimax algorithm that prioritizes edges and corners and assumes the opponent will do the same. <br>
It can also read in a board and output an 'optimal' move - <b>oModerator.py</b> (written by instructor) plays two such programs against each other for multiple rounds and records the win/loss results at the end. <br>
  
## salesman
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) in Python  
**Iterative** - randomly generates a path, then "untangles" it, eliminating all intersections between line segments in the path. After untangling, the program makes local optimizations, which minimizes path length in sets of 4-8 adjacent points.  
**Genetic algorithm** - creates a size N population of untangled paths and measures path fitness inversely with path length. Each generation cycle creates N/2 "children paths" by combining two members of the current population. The least fit N/2 members of the new population are then removed from the set.

## nQueens
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkevinkuo/tjhsst/master/nqueens/nqueens30.png" width="40%" align="right">
This Python script places N queens on a NxN board with queens such that none of them attack each other. <br>
<b>Brute force backtracking</b> - Generates all possible boards one queen at a time and only works off legal permutations (i.e. will eliminate a "solution" that contains a queen in A1 and another in B2, even if the board size is 8).  Returns a list of all possible boards. Time efficiency is n! due to brute force nature. <br>
<b>Hill climbing</b> - Generates a random board and checks single column swaps to reduce # of conflicts. Sometimes, a solution cannot be found due to the starting spot (we reach a 'local minimum'), in which case we generate a new board and restart. <br>
<b>Genetic algorithm</b> - Similar to the genetic TSP method. Splices parent boards by copying the front of parent 1 (up to a specified pivot point) and appending the rest of the unused numbers in the order they occur in parent 2. This algorithm's time efficiency is far more reliable than the above two methods at large N.<br>
  
## neuralnetwork
WIP    
  
## imageprocessing
All the image feature detection techniques below are implemented in Python.  
**Grayscale & Edge detection (Sobel+Canny)**

**Line Detection**  
<nowiki>*</nowiki>the third image plots two variables, rho and theta. Pixel intensity increases with likelyhood of being a line.

## mandelbrot
This C program plots a shaded Mandelbrot Set using glut and GL.  
Allows the user to zoom in/out indefinitely and increase/decrease calculation precision.  
MPIbrot has identical function, but can use multiple processing cores using mpirun.

## raytracing
This C program uses raytracing techniques to draw simple 3d graphics on a 640x480 pixel canvas. The different stages of shading are shown below.

## forestfire
This C program simulates a "forest fire" where fire spreads to adjacent cells.  
Uses system time as a seed to generate trees in a grid. Several trials are conducted with varying "tree densities", and the program calculates the density with the longest normalized burnout time (# of iterations until burnout, divided by grid size).  
  
## sociallinks  
This Python script simulates two ways of making connections.
Group one starts with a given population and draws random links between everyone. The plot is given by graphrand.jpg.  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkevinkuo/tjhsst/master/sociallinks//graphrand.jpg" width="50%">  
Group two starts with a small number of people (a "popular group") who all know each other. We iteratively add new members to the society and give each new member a few social links. The resulting graph is shown by graphiter.jpg.  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkevinkuo/tjhsst/master/sociallinks//graphiter.jpg" width="50%">  
Note that the first graph is shaped more symmetrically, while in the second, there are only a few popular people and most people (the new members added later) only have a few connections.  
  
## fireflies
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkevinkuo/tjhsst/master/fireflies/fireflies.png" width="30%" align="right">  
This Python script displays fireflies (yellow dots) on a night (black) background.<br><br>
All fireflies have a set 'charge-up' time, but have random start times. <br><br>

When a firefly 'discharges', it will display full intensity yellow dot on the screen, which then fades. Discharging a light will also cause nearby fireflies to also adjust their discharge times to more closely match the source.<br><br>

After enough time passes, all of the fireflies will discharge and light up together.<br>
  
## closestpoints
This C++ program compares three algorithms for finding the two closest points in a set.  
**Brute force** - O(n^2)  
**Recursive partitioning** - O(nlog(n))  
**Sieve**: O(n), documented in ["A Simple Randomized Sieve Algorithm for the Closest-Pair Problem"](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/grant/cp.pdf)  
  
## huffman
This simple C program implements Huffman encoding and decoding. It uses one Amendement from the U.S. Constitution for each of the sample .txt files.
